  h4 About the rates
  ul.default
    li 15% VAT, 2% bedlevy, land tax and <u>conservation fee</u> are included in the rates
    li Any change in our government tax is excluded in the rates
    li If you make a reservation via a travel agent or tour operator please mention "halfboard <strong>and</strong> activities" which is our package price, <strong>only</strong> halfboard does <strong>not</strong> include the activities.
  
  h5 Conservation Fee
  p With 14.000 ha and a lot game (including big game) we face the same costs as public parks for maintaining roads, fences, boreholes, dams, fire breakers and other environmental matters (<a href="eco-award.html">see Eco award</a>). We also have to build accommodation for staff. In the past we have covered these costs only with the room rates without mentioning. Since 2010 we have published the conservation fee for more transparency. Now everyone should have a better base to compare our rates with B&Bs or hotels where these conservation costs do not exist.
