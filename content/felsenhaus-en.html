  <p>Felsenhaus is our guesthouse with a great view overlooking the riverbed. This guesthouse holds our 2 best rooms, which both have a en-suite bathroom. The rooms have a terrace on the opposite side, so you will be ensured of plenty of privacy. The rooms have limited air-conditioning. It is limited to certain fixed hours which is not manually adjustable (because of our limited power usage).</p>
