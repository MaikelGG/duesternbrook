    <h1>Horse riding</h1>

<div class="section-page">
  <p>Experience the african wildlife from the back of a horse. The way to get up close and personal with animals such as kudu, oryx, zebra and giraffe.</p>
  <p>Start your trip through Namibia with a few days of riding here on our farm. An experience you will not soon forget and far more intense then regular game viewing. No disrupt from the sound of car engines and you will make a new friend who will take you up close with the wildlife. Also because of the scent of horses, wildlife will be much more relax around your presence.</p>
  <p>Picture yourself riding in the African landscape when the early morning sun is climbing the horizon and the wind blows through the tall grass. You will ride amongst mountains and dry riverbeds. When you come back from your ride you can relax by the pool, read a book or go for a hike. In the afternoon you can join our Cats Unlimited tour and see leopards and cheetahs from the safety of a car. Of course we will provide you with drinks and quality food from our European cuisine. Every night we serve a 3-course dinner family style. In the evening you can reflect the day and meet our other guests from all around the world. Good conversion!</p>
