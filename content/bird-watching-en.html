  <p>We have documented five southern African endemics (South African Shelduck, Cape Vulture, Ashy Tit, Anteating Chat, and Rockrunner). The walking trails offer particularly good birding venues. Our guides have some training in bird identification and we have checklists, binoculars, and field guides available on request.</p>

  <p>We have a extensive list of birds that were observed in July 2015. This will give you a good impression.</p>
